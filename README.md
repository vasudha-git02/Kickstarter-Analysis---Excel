# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 The overview of the project is to help an upcoming playwright Louise who wants to start a crowfunding program to fund her upcoming play Fever.
### Purpose
The purpose is to sort, organize and analyze this crowfunding data to determine the specific factors that make this campaign project successful . 

## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis is done to determine how different campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Line charts are used to perform this analysis


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When we look at the line chart of outcomes based on the launch month we can find that the number of campaigns are high dduring mid year and also most campaigns are successful during the mid - year especially during May the number of successful campaigns are very high. Also as the year comes to an end so as the number of successful campaigns  reduced. In the number of failed campaigns there isn't vast difference in the number during the year but there is slight increase in the failed campaigns during mid year . Cancelled campigns are very less and almost the same through out the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The line chart of outcomes based on goals tells us that campaigns are successful when the goal range is less than 1000 and percentage successful campaigns reduced as the goal amount increased. But there is an increase in the successful campaigns during 35000 to 40000 goal range. When we look at the graph we also find that the percentage of failed campaigns increased from the goal amount of 40000 and peak failed campaigns occured when the goal is greater than 45000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge I faced is with the data in the goal amount column. During practise few of the rows data was jumbled and so the calculation and graph wasnt correct. I then took a fresh copy and compared and corrected the data. I even used some of the things I learnt here in correcting this data.

## Results
Based on the graph I can tell that most successful campaigns were in the mid of the year when the number of campaigns were more and also higher the goal higher the percentage of failed outcomes.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
